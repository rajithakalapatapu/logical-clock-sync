# global variable for storing server socket - accessed by thread and main
server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

# a global data structure for storing the connected clients
#   connected_clients is a dict of tuples
#       keys are the address tuple containing host and port
#       values are a tuple which contains (client_socket, client_address, client_name)
#   {
#       (address_tuple): (client_socket, client_address_tuple, client_name)
#   }
# EXAMPLE:
# the example below shows 2 clients
# client 1 is called 'c1' and has the address ('127.0.0.1', 36852)
# client 2 is called 'c2' and has the address ('127.0.0.1', 36854)
#   {
#       ('127.0.0.1', 36852): (   <socket.socket fd=8, family=AddressFamily.AF_INET, type=2049, proto=0, laddr=('127.0.0.1', 9997), raddr=('127.0.0.1', 36852)>,
#                               ('127.0.0.1', 36852),
#                               'c1'),
#       ('127.0.0.1', 36854): (   <socket.socket fd=9, family=AddressFamily.AF_INET, type=2049, proto=0, laddr=('127.0.0.1', 9997), raddr=('127.0.0.1', 36854)>,
#                               ('127.0.0.1', 36854),
#                               'c2')
#   }
#   To send data to client c1, we use the client socket object with fd=8
#   To know what is the name of the client, we use the value tuple to find that.
#   The name of the client is in the second index (third element) of the tuple -
#   in this case, it is "c1"
